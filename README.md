This project was meant to evolve my understanding of cyber security concepts such as securely storing passwords with encryption, hashing and salting, and properly laying out the database. 
I used postgresql17 for the database portion storing users, passwords, keys, password_history, and accounts as seperate tables. Foreign keys are used to communicate information between tables.
